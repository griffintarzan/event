# 2021 New Year Countdown

A website with a countdown clock to New Year 2021.
This was a short project to celebrate the new year with my friends, who were all seniors going to graduate highschool this year!
When the countdown ends, a button will pop up and lead to another page consisted of my message to my friends.
